Cheat Online Voting Contests

Hold the Door Challenge - Cheat Online Voting Contests ðŸšª
This repoistory contains Python scripts written for a web scraping challenge project completed as part of the Year 1 curriculum at Holberton School. In this project, I used Python's requests, BeautifulSoup, and pytesseract packages to simulate votes for a series of increasingly complicated voting contest websites.

For each level, I was challenged with writing a script to submit a certain number of votes to a PHP form. The levels and their corresponding scripts are listed below:

Level 0

level_0/1024.py: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times here.
Level 1

level_1/4096.py: Votes with my Holberton ID 4096 times here.
Level 2

level_2/1024.py: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times here.
Level 3

level_3/1024.py: Votes with my Holberton ID 1024 times here.
Level 4

level_4/98.py: Votes with my Holberton ID 98 times here.
